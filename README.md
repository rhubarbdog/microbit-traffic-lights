Traffic lights for a microbit

There are 2 circuit diagrams, the simple method has a problem.  When 2 LEDs are on the current takes the easiest route, the red LED glows brightly and the amber one is very dim.  The amber LED and red LED have similar electrical characteristics, should the example require the green and amber LED to be illuminated at the same time one would be almost totally snuffed out.

Solution, insert some transistors that is the second circuit diagram the correct method.
